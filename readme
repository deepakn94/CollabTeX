How to Run the Server
---------------------
The main file to run the server is called Server.java
and can be found in the server package. Just run the 
file as a Java application to get the server running on
your local machine. 

How to Run the Client
---------------------
To run the client you will need to run the Controller.java
file which can be found under the view. The client can specify
the IP address and port of the server it is trying to connect
to. The default IP address is 127.0.0.1 and the default port
is 4444. If you want to specify both IP and port, go to the run
configurations of Controller in Eclipse and se the first
argument to the IP address and the second argument to the port.
