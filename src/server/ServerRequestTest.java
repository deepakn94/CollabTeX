 * Testing strategy:

 * In this JUnit test file, we test the ServerRequest.java file.
 * In particular, we perform the following checks to check if a server request is parsed properly-
 * 	1. Check that the server request is of the right type
 * 	2. Check that the identifier for each request is correctly stripped
 * 	3. Check that incorrect server requests are identified correctly
